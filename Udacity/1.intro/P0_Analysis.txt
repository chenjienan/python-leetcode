Task 0:
Let the size of calls be n, and the size of texts be m
getting the first and last records are performing O(1)

Task 1:
Let the size of calls be n, and the size of texts be m
traversing all records require O(n + m)

Task 2
Let the size of calls be n
scan through all phones in calls is O(n)
get the max duration O(n)
O(n + n) = O(2n) => O(n)

Task 3
Let the size of calls be n
scan through all phones in calls is O(n)
sorting:O(nlogn)
output: O(m) (m <= n)
total: O(nlogn + n + m) => O(nlogn)

Task 4
Let the size of calls be n, and the size of texts be m
O(n + mlogm)
